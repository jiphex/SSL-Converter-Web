SSL Format Converter
====================

A simple web application which allows users to upload SSL 
certificates/keys as X509 PEM files or password-protected PKCS7 
.DER/.PFX files, and then allows them to download them as PEM or DER 
files, regardless of the original upload format.

OpenSSL is used for all the SSL certificate conversion.

Requirements:

+ sinatra
+ haml
+ json
+ sqlite3
+ openssl (should be included with your ruby distribution)

Optional:

+ httparty (for the client)
